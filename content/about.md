Hey!
I'm Nick, from the UK, and I am completing a BTEC National Extended Diploma in Digital Development.

My hobbies largely consist of [programming](https://www,github.com/nsgwick/), reading, drawing and running. I sometimes do photography too, and have quite a large portfolio of pictures on Instagram ([@nicksphotos.\_](https://www.instagram.com/nicksphotos._/])).
I keep my drawing Instagram account updated with scans of my latest drawings, and usually delete older drawings. You can check out my latest ones by following [@nick\_.\_art](https://www.instagram.com/nick_._art/).

One more creative hobby of mine is occasional music production. I use [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) 10 Standard as my DAW and publish tracks on the music platforms as Glostrode ([Spotify artist page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7errC26iwGliXFBlzXEgUu?si=0WZoMriCR7OCwrOlwYQn-A)).

I'm currently reading [The 5AM Club](https://www.amazon.co.uk/5-AM-Club-Robin-Sharma/dp/0008312834) by Robin Sharma, [The Art of Resilience](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Resilience-Ross-Edgley/dp/000835698X) by Ross Edgley, [Good Vibes Good Life](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Vibes-Life-Self-Love-Unlocking/dp/1788171829) by Vex King, and I'm working through [The C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0131103628/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) by K & R.

Of course I like to play a game now and then. I sometimes play on [my private Minecraft server](https://www.planetminecraft.com/server/the-chill-nw-smp/) and I enjoy playing [Forza Horizon 5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551360/Forza_Horizon_5/) a little now and then when I feel like it.

I bought my PC on 3rd September 2020, making it almost 2 years old. It still works as new, with an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X, NVIDIA RTX 2070 Super. 32GB 3000MHz DDR4 RAM, and a heck of a lot of storage. Not to mention my 32" monitor (which I chose for coding purposes).

If you wish to contact me in the gaming world, you can add me on Discord as `@Glo-strode#0001`. My Steam username is `CITNALENCIAGA`, and my Minecraft IGN is the one and only `Glostrode`. I do not game a lot for the sake of my health and productivity. I like this quote:


> One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. We are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today.<br>
